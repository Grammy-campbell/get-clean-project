CODE BOOK for the end of class project in Getting and Cleaning Data
L. K. Campbell

There are 81 variables in the final tidy data set.  Each record relates to one participant performing
one of the six activities, so the first two variables are:

subject: This is an integer between 1 and 30 indicating which of the 30 study participants the
	data pertains to.

activity: Each of the participants was tested doing each of 6 different activities (Walking, Walking Up,
	Walking Down, Sitting, Standing, and Laying)

The remaining 79 variables record the average value for that subject/activity pair for each of the variables
listed below.

[Note: Raw data on acceleration was divided into two components, acceleration of the body and gravity.]
